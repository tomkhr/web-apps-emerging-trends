- Web application development â€“ assignment: implementing emerging trends


# Why Spline

I chose Spline As the chosen emerging trend for these project because I have always been intrigued by 3D design and animations. I came across Spline a couple years back when i discovered it's integration with Webflow and I played around with it a bit at the time. When researching which technology to use for this assignment, I figured it would be an exciting opportunity to try and integrate a Spline 3D scene into a React app, which would give me insight into what is possible and how powerful the combination of the two could be for potential projects in the future that may be more complex. I think Spline's lean towards simple user friendly 3D experiences that are optimized for the web could be an opportunity to build projects that would could combine the power behind React and the visual appeal, gamification, and innovative opportunities offered by Spline.

# How was Spline integrated in this project 

For this project I wanted to first explore putting together a 3D composition that is made of simple shapes, and tie it to an informative webpage of some sort. From recently going over the concept of Atomic Design in the context of the web, I decided to create a 3D web presentation about the elements in Atmoic Design.

# How to run the code

To run this web app locally, first, you'll need to open the project folder with a code editor such as VS Code. Then proceed to opening a new terminal windoe and directing to the project folder using the "cd emergin-trends-spline" command. Then, simply run the "npm run dev" command to launch the app to your local host, once it is running, copy the local host address from the terminal and paste it in the address bar of your chosen web browser. 

# Dependencies

The only dependencies required to run this project are:
    - node modules  ( to install, run the command " npm install " )
    - spline        ( to install, run the command " npm install @splinetool/react-spline @splinetool/runtime " )
